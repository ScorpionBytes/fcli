fcli.scm.usage.header = Utility commands related to Source Control Management

# GitHub
fcli.scm.github.api-url = GitHub API URL. For github.com, this should be https://api.github.com/ (default value). For GitHub Enterprise, this should be https://<host>/api/v3.
fcli.scm.github.token = GitHub Personal Access Token. 
fcli.scm.github-contributor.usage.header = View contributors to GitHub repositories
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.usage.header = List contributors to GitHub repositories
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.usage.description.0 = The output of this command can help with determining the number of contributing developers as defined by the Fortify NCD license. The output should be considered indicative only; for example, a single author can commit code from multiple contributors, and a single contributor may be listed multiple times when committing code with different author name, email or login.\n 
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.usage.description.1 = This command outputs a list of people that contributed to one or more GitHub repositories in the time period specified through the '--last [x]d' option. If neither '--organizations' or --'repositories' options are specified, this command will process all repositories for all organizations to which the user that created the GitHub token is assigned. Authors are de-duplicated per repository; if someone contributed to multiple repositories, this person will be listed multiple times.\n
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.usage.description.2 = In order to include all relevant repositories, please make sure that the given GitHub token (and associated user) has read-access to every organization and repository being processed by this command, including private repositories. A classic GitHub Token with full Repo scope seems to work best. Tokens can be created via GitHub Account Settings->Developer Settings->Personal Access tokens.\n  
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.usage.description.3 = The most common approach for utilizing this command is to use the '-o csv' option to output the data to a CSV file, and loading this CSV file into Excel for further processing, de-duplication and record removal (for example removing bot authors).
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.last = Load contribution data for the given time period, for example last '5d' (5 days). Default value: ${DEFAULT-VALUE} (which corresponds to what is stated in the NCD license terms). 
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.no-older = By default, this command includes the latest contribution older than the given time period if there are no contributions within the specified time period (which corresponds to what is stated in the NCD license terms). Use --no-older to only include contributions for the given time period.
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.organizations = Load data for all repositories (accessible by the given token) for the given organizations. This option accepts multiple organizations separated by comma's. 
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.repositories = Load data for for the given repositories only. This option accepts multiple repositories separated by comma's.
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.loading.organizations = Loading organizations
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.loading.repositories = Loading repositories for organization %s
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.loading.repository = Loading data for repository %s
fcli.scm.github-contributor.list.output.header.repositoryFullName = Repository
